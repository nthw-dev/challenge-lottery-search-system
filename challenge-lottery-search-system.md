## Lottery Search System

### Objective (Lottery Search System)

Design a real-world solution to search a large dataset of lottery tickets using pattern matching with wildcard support.

> This section is a design exercise. Do not implement code.

### Requirements (Lottery Search System)

#### 1. Data Volume

- Handle a dataset of **10 million** lottery tickets
- Each ticket is a 6-digit number

#### 2. Search Pattern

- Support a 6-character search pattern containing digits and wildcards (`*`)
- Example patterns:

| Pattern | Matches |
| --- | --- |
| `****23` | Numbers ending in `23` |
| `1****5` | Numbers starting with `1` and ending with `5` |
| `123***` | Numbers starting with `123` |

#### 3. Result Distribution

- Constraint: the same search pattern should not return the same ticket to multiple users at the same time
- Propose a distribution mechanism so matching tickets are assigned without duplicate simultaneous selection

#### 4. Performance

- Ensure the search is performant for `10M+` records
- Propose an efficient approach for querying and allocation

#### 5. Real-World Design Proposal (No Code Required)

- Recommend the database/storage technology you would use in production and explain why
- Describe the algorithm and indexing strategy used for wildcard pattern matching
- Explain how you would prevent duplicate simultaneous results for the same pattern (for example, locking, reservation, or atomic allocation)
- No code implementation is required; provide a solution/design only

### Deliverables (Lottery Search System)

Submit a design document only (no code implementation) that includes:

- Proposed solution architecture, data structures, and algorithms
- Recommended production database/storage choice with justification (for example, query performance, concurrency handling, operational simplicity)
- Performance analysis summarizing efficiency and tradeoffs
- Concurrency/distribution strategy explaining how duplicate results are avoided for the same pattern

### Evaluation Criteria (Lottery Search System)

- Feasibility: the solution addresses the stated requirements
- Performance: the search approach is efficient for the target scale
- Correctness: the distribution constraint is handled correctly
- Real-world practicality: the database/storage and concurrency approach are appropriate for production use
- Creativity: thoughtful use of data structures and algorithms
